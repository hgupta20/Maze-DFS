# Maze-DFS
### Maze Solving Algorithm using Depth First Search

A C program that will find its way through a maze using the depth-first search algorithm. This program takes input from a file where the filename is specified in the command line arguments. The input file will only contain two integer values per line of input:

- The first valid line gives the size of the 2-D maze (the number of rows given by the first number, then the number of columns given by the second number), valid values are >= 1.
- The second valid line gives the coordinates of the starting position in the maze.
- The third valid line gives the coordinates of the ending position in the maze.
- The remaining valid lines in the file give the coordinates of blocked positions in the maze.
